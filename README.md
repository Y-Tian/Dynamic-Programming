# Dynamic-Programming

Canadian Computing Contest Questions year 2014 and 2015

Easy questions implemented as functions in "CCC2014" & "CCC2015". Harder questions pushed separately.

My own answer for the hardest questions in those years (Q.5). Able to pass runtime limit on CCC-OnlineGrader.

Had to utilize dynamic programming techniques in order to gain faster runtime results.
